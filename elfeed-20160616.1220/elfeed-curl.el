;;; elfeed-curl.el --- curl backend for Elfeed -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Comments:

;; An alternative to `url-retrieve' and `url-queue' that fetches URLs
;; using the curl command line program.

;; The API is three functions:

;; * `elfeed-curl-retrieve'
;; * `elfeed-curl-retrieve-synchronously'
;; * `elfeed-curl-enqueue'

;; And has four buffer-local variables for use in callbacks:

;; * `elfeed-curl-headers'
;; * `elfeed-curl-status-code'
;; * `elfeed-curl-error-message'
;; * `elfeed-curl-location'

;;; Code:
